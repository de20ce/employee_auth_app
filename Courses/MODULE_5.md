## Slide 1: Introduction to Hyperparameters

**Hyperparameters** are settings or configurations used to control the training process of a model.

- **Network Structure Hyperparameters:** Define the architecture of the model (e.g., number of layers, type of activation functions).
- **Training Algorithm Hyperparameters:** Control the learning process (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).

## Slide 2: Network Structure Hyperparameters

1. **Hidden Layers:**
   - More hidden layers can model more complex data patterns.
   - Risk of overfitting if too many layers are used.

2. **Dropout:**
   - A regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
   - Typical dropout rate is between 20-50%.

## Slide 3: Activation Functions and Weight Initialization

1. **Activation Functions:**
   - Introduce non-linearity to the model.
   - Commonly used functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Softmax.
   - ReLU is preferred for hidden layers, while Sigmoid and Softmax are used for output layers depending on the task.

2. **Weight Initialization:**
   - Proper initialization is crucial for effective learning.
   - Common methods: Xavier initialization, He initialization.

## Slide 4: Training Algorithm Hyperparameters

1. **Learning Rate:**
   - Controls how quickly the model adapts to the problem.
   - A lower learning rate may lead to slower convergence but better accuracy.
   - A decaying learning rate schedule can help improve performance over time.

2. **Momentum:**
   - Helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging.

## Slide 5: Epochs and Batch Size

1. **Number of Epochs:**
   - Refers to the number of times the entire training dataset is passed forward and backward through the network.
   - Too few epochs can lead to underfitting; too many can cause overfitting.

2. **Batch Size:**
   - Defines the number of training examples used in one iteration.
   - Smaller batch sizes often provide a regularization effect but can slow down training.
