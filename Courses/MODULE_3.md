# Module 3: How Face Recognition Works

## Slide 1: Overview of Face Recognition Process

Face Recognition generally consists of three main phases:

1. **Preprocessing:** Preparing the facial data.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Identifying distinctive features.
3. **Matching:** Comparing extracted features against a database.

## Slide 2: Preprocessing - Face Detection

**Face Detection** is the process of locating and identifying the presence of a face in an image. Common techniques include:

1. **Haar Cascades:** Developed by Viola and Jones, uses simple classifiers for quick detection.
2. **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG):** Utilizes gradient orientation histograms for detection.
3. **Deep Learning Models:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide high accuracy.

## Slide 3: Preprocessing - Face Alignment

**Face Alignment** adjusts the orientation and size of the face to match a standard template. Techniques include:

1. **Geometric Transformations:** Rotates and scales the face to align key features.
2. **Facial Landmark Detection:** Detects key points on the face for precise alignment.

## Slide 4: Feature Extraction - Key Techniques

Feature Extraction involves identifying distinctive facial features. Common methods include:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality while preserving important information.
2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** Finds linear combinations of features that best separate classes.
3. **Deep Learning Models:** CNNs learn hierarchical feature representations directly from images.

## Slide 5: Matching - Techniques and Algorithms

The final phase of face recognition is **Matching**, where the extracted features are compared against a database of known faces.

1. **Similarity Measures:** Techniques such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity are used to compare feature vectors.
2. **Classification Algorithms:** Models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or neural networks classify the input face.
