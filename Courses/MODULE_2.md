## Slide 1: Early Concepts and Pioneers

- **1960s:** Woodrow W. Bledsoe developed some of the earliest facial recognition algorithms.
  - Required manual feature location (e.g., eyes, ears, noses) on photographs.
- **1970s:** Goldstein, Harmon, and Lesk created an automated system using 21 subjective markers.

## Slide 2: Milestones in Automated Face Recognition

- **1980s:** Introduction of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by Sirovich and Kirby.
  - **PCA:** Reduced complexity by transforming images into a set of orthogonal components (Eigenfaces).
- **1991:** Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland expanded PCA with real-time face recognition using Eigenfaces.

## Slide 3: Evolution of Face Recognition: From PCA to Deep Learning

- **1990s:** Fisherfaces and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) introduced to enhance face recognition.
- **2000s:** Emergence of 3D Face Recognition and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to overcome 2D limitations.
