## Slide 1: What is Face Recognition?

**Face Recognition** is a biometric technology used to identify or verify a person's identity by analyzing their facial features.

- Involves capturing images or 3D representations of a person's face.
- Compares captured data with stored facial data to find a match.

## Slide 2: Importance of Face Recognition

Face Recognition is crucial in many modern applications:

- **Security Systems:** Unlocking devices, surveillance.
- **Identity Verification:** Airport security, banking.
- **Social Media:** Tagging friends in photos.
- **Law Enforcement:** Identifying suspects.

## Slide 3: Overview of Face Recognition Technology

Face Recognition technology generally consists of three phases:

1. **Preprocessing:** Face detection and alignment.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Identifying distinctive facial features.
3. **Matching:** Comparing features with a database of known faces.
